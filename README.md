# VGG-16 & Inception-V3-Cotton-Disease-Prediction
# Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/janmejaybhoi/cotton-disease-dataset
# Description 
  ## About the problem: We have four classes of cotton images which are diseased cotton leaf, diseased cotton plant, fresh cotton leaf and fresh cotton leaf. So, we have to build   ##   the model in such a way If we feed the images into the model It can able to detect whether those images belong to the which classes?
