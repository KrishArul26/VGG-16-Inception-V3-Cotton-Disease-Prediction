<h4 align="left"> Description </h2>
* About the problem: We have four classes of cotton images which are diseased cotton leaf, diseased cotton plant, fresh cotton leaf and fresh cotton leaf. So, we have to build    the model in such a way If we feed the images into the model It can able to detect whether those images belong to the which classes?
